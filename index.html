The film unfolds in four distinct chapters, each representing different aspects of Mishima's life and work: his childhood and formative years, his rise to literary fame, his political activism and nationalist beliefs, and his dramatic final moments. Blending elements of biography, fiction, and surrealism, "Mishima" explores the complex interplay between art, identity, and ideology in the life of one of Japan's most enigmatic figures. Through its innovative structure, striking visuals, and Philip Glass's evocative score, the film offers a compelling meditation on the nature of creativity, obsession, and the search for meaning.
